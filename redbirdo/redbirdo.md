**a. technologies**

If I were writing this app myself I'd use the Symfony framework with PHP, because I have lots of experience with it - to a man with a hammer, everything looks like a nail ;0)

As this project will be a GirlsCodeMK collaboration and intended to provide intersting and useful experience for those involved in it, I would recommend one of the following options:

1. Front end react JS framework, back end API node JS with the express framework.
2. Django Python framework.

I would recommend these for the following reasons:

1. As far as I can gather, JS / React / Django are technologies that multiple members of GirlsCodeMK are already learning or interested in, and for which the group has mentors available.
2. They are mature technologies with a lot of functionality out of the box and learning resources available.
3. Working with any of these will develop desirable skills.

**b. contribution**

I would like to contribute in any way that would be useful - e.g. help designing the app, implementing it and mentoring others where applicable.

**c. hackathon**

I would love to join in this hackathon.
