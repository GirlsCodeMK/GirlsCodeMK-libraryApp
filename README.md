# GirlsCode MK - library App

This is a repository for GirlsCode MK library app. All the code has been carefully crafted by the members of GirlsCode MK. _We are the new Facebook_.

## The idea

GirlsCode MK has a library of programming books that all of our members can use. To make the process easier and more enjoyable for everyone involved, we want to design a library app that we will use to checkout books, see which books are available, which are recommended by other students.

## What can you find here?

Anything from sketches, photos to masterful code. More details to come as the project gets updated.

## How to contribute?

To contribute:

1. Fork this repository
2. Clone the repository to your computer

4. add a .md file with your ideas for the library app, answer the following questions:

   b. how would you like to contribute to the project?
   c. we would like to organise a hackathon to write the library app. The hackathon will take place on a Saturday. Would you be interested in joining us?
