# GirlsCode MK - library App

This is a repository for GirlsCode MK library app. All the code has been carefully crafted by the members of GirlsCode MK. _We are the new Facebook_. 


## The idea

GirlsCode MK has a library of programming books that all of our members can use. To make the process easier and more enjoyable for everyone involved, we want to design a library app that we will use to checkout books, see which books are available, which are recommended by other students.

## What can you find here?

Anything from sketches, photos to masterful code. More details to come as the project gets updated.
